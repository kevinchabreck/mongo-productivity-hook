# program: post-commit
# author: Kevin Chabreck
# description: a git post-commit hook that records commit metadata in a MongoDB database.
# 
#			   Commit documents will be stored in the following form:
#
#			   { "hash": the hash of the commit
#				 "day": the day the commit occured. int in range 0 - 6 (0 == monday, 6 == sunday)
#				 "hour": the hour the commit occured. int in range 0-23 (0 == 12am, 23 == 11pm)
#				 "minute": the minute the commit occured. int in range 0 - 59
#				 "insertions": the total number of line insertions
#				 "deletions": the total number of line deletions
#				 "files": the total number of files edited
#				 "size": the difference in size (in bytes) between the two most recent commits }


# fetch the hash and the timestamp from the most recent commit

	line = lines[i].split('\t')
	insertions += int(line[0])
	deletions += int(line[1])
files = len(lines) - 2

# get the hash of each blob in the most recent two commits, and sum
# the size difference from each blob pair to get the total commit size
p = subprocess.Popen(["git", "diff-tree", hash], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

	else:
